#+LANGUAGE: en

* solo-rpg.el

A set of support functions and Transient-based dashboards for playing solo roleplaying games directly inside Emacs. It provides dice rolling, multiple oracles, and generators, allowing you to generate campaign events without ever leaving your editor.

** Features
- *Dice Roller:* Parse and roll standard RPG dice strings (e.g., =2d6+2=, =1d20-1=).
- *Oracles:*
  - *Yes/No Oracle:* Probability-weighted answers (e.g., "Highly Likely", "50/50") with critical event triggers.
  - *Action/Theme Oracle:* Abstract prompt generator inspired by the Mythic Game Master Emulator.
  - *Quantity Oracle:* Quickly determine how much or how many of something exists.
- *Generators:* Instantly generate standard RPG elements:
  - Plots and Quest Hooks
  - NPC Appearances
  - Dungeon Rooms (4AD style)
- *Sleek UI:* Fully driven by Emacs =transient= menus for a modern, discoverable interface.
- *Flexible Output:* Route generated text directly into your active buffer, or restrict it to the echo area to keep your notes clean.

** Installation

*** MELPA (Coming Soon)
Once the package is available on MELPA, you can install it easily using =use-package=:

#+begin_src elisp
(use-package solo-rpg
  :ensure t
  :bind (("C-c r" . solo-rpg-menu))
  :hook (text-mode . solo-rpg-mode))
#+end_src

*** Manual Installation
1. Clone this repository or download =solo-rpg.el=.
2. Place it somewhere in your Emacs =load-path=.
3. Add the following to your =init.el=:

#+begin_src elisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/solo-rpg")
(require 'solo-rpg)
(define-key global-map (kbd "C-c r") 'solo-rpg-menu)
#+end_src

** Usage
To start playing, simply activate the minor mode in your campaign notes buffer:

=M-x solo-rpg-mode=

Then, trigger the main dashboard using your configured hotkey (e.g., =C-c r=) or by typing =M-x solo-rpg-menu=. The Transient menu will guide you through all available tools.

** Configuration
You can customize the behavior of =solo-rpg= using standard Emacs customization:

=M-x customize-group RET solo-rpg RET=

*Key Variables:*
- =solo-rpg-output-method=: Set to ='insert= (default) to print results directly into your buffer, or ='message= to only show them in the minibuffer. This can also be toggled on the fly from the main Transient menu.
